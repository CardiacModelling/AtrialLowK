One guideline:

1 column ~ 82 mm
2 column ~ 170 mm
max height 100 mm

Matplotlib likes inches, so approx:

1 column ~ 3.2 inches
2 column ~ 6.7 inches

However, matplotlib chooses quite large fonts and thick lines by default...
So looks nicer to use

1 column ~ 4.28 inches
2 column ~ 9 inches

I measured the ratios in frontiers figures to get max heights (including
caption) of

~ 11.6 inches
